## After installation

- The script runs automatically
- You do not need to activate anything
- You can play normally

If something behaves strangely:

- Double-check that **each tab** contains exactly the code shown
- Make sure the **Library** tab is not empty

---

## Updating the script

If a new version is released:

1. Copy the new **Library** code from this page
2. Replace the content of the **Library** tab in the scenario page
3. Save again

---

## Troubleshooting

**The game errors immediately**

- One of the tabs may contains partial or malformed code, copy everything again
  and retry

**Nothing seems to change**

- Make sure you clicked **SAVE** after editing scripts

---

## Optional: advanced usage

If you are comfortable with code and want to customize the script:

- Visit the
  [GitHub](https://github.com/greyboxsystems/dungeon-ai-script-template)
  repository
- Read the developer documentation
- Modify and rebuild the library yourself
